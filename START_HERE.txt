STEP 1: Install GitHub CLI Manually
================================================================================

Since automated installation didn't work, please do this manually:

1. Open your web browser

2. Go to this link:
   https://github.com/cli/cli/releases/latest

3. Look for a file that ends with .msi (example: gh_2.40.1_windows_amd64.msi)
   Click on it to download

4. When download finishes, double-click the .msi file

5. Click "Next" through the installer, then "Install"

6. When done, click "Finish"

7. IMPORTANT: Close this Command Prompt window and open a NEW one

8. In the NEW Command Prompt, test by typing:
   gh --version

   If you see a version number, it worked!

9. Then come back and tell me "done" and I'll continue with Step 2

================================================================================
ALTERNATIVE: Use GitHub Web Interface (No CLI Needed!)
================================================================================

If you don't want to install GitHub CLI, you can do everything through the 
GitHub website instead. Tell me "use web interface" and I'll give you those
instructions instead.

================================================================================
OR: Use .gitignore Only (Simplest)
================================================================================

The SIMPLEST option that requires NO installations:
- Just use .gitignore to exclude packages from Git
- Users download packages from other sources
- Tell me "use gitignore only" if you want this

================================================================================

What would you like to do?
1. "done" - After you install GitHub CLI manually
2. "use web interface" - I'll show you how to use GitHub website
3. "use gitignore only" - Simplest option, no tools needed
